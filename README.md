# Cafe-Menu
Using HTML and CSS to design a menu page for a cafe webpage
Procedure:
**HTML Part**

The div tag is short for "division." It's a versatile and widely-used tag that allows you to group together elements in your web page. Think of it as a container for other elementsâ€”text, images, links, tables, or even other div tags. By using div, you can structure your content, style it with CSS, and manage it more effectively.

The section tag in HTML is used to define a thematic grouping of content, typically related to a specific topic or purpose. It's like a way to organize content into meaningful sections within your webpage. While the <div> tag is more generic, the <section> tag carries semantic value, which helps both developers and browsers understand the structure of your content more effectively.

The article tag in HTML is used to represent self-contained, independently distributable content.

The img tag in HTML is used to embed images into a webpage. It's essential for adding visual elements to your content, such as pictures, illustrations, logos, or icons. Unlike some other tags, <img> is a self-closing tag, meaning it doesn't require a closing img tag

The link tag in HTML is primarily used to define the relationship between an HTML document and external resources. Most commonly, it's used to link to stylesheets, which help control the design and layout of your webpage. The link tag is placed within the head section of your HTML document.

**CSS Part**
In CSS, the . (dot) is used to target and style elements with a specific class. A class is an attribute you can assign to an HTML element to group it with other elements that share the same styling rules. The dot is the selector that tells CSS to apply the style rules to elements with that particular class.

In CSS, curly brackets {} are used to group the style declarations for a particular selector. They serve as a container to hold the rules that define how an element should appear. Every CSS rule begins with a selector (such as .class or #id), followed by curly brackets enclosing the styling properties and their values.
